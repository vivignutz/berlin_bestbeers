# Berlin Bestbeers - A beermap of Berlin

As my fourth portfolio project (PP4) with Code Institute, I created a website with a blog application in Django built for people who enjoy craft beer. It is targeted towards people who want to find craft beer bars around Berlin, Germany.
The purpose of this webpage is to allow users to participate posting their experiences on craft beer bars, upload fotos, comment and like on other posts.
